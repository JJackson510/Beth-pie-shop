    <h2>Our history</h2>
    <p style="font-family: Verdana;">
        For many years, <b>Bethany</b> has been baking the most delicious pies at her home. In 2013, we opened our first
        store in Brussels (Belgium) in a cosy little street near the Grand Market. People from all over the world fell in love
        with the soft cakes, heavenly cheese cakes, spicy apple pies... <i>The store became a success in no time.</i>
        <br>In 2015, no less than 100 pies were sold every day and Bethany's Pie Shop moved into a larger building.
        After receiving many requests, it became clear that our next step was making it possible to order pies from the
        comfort of your own home and from anywhere in the world. You are now looking at the result of this: our very own
        webstore, making it possible to order Bethany's delicious pies whenever you feel like it!

        Bethany is famous for using only the best ingredients. This way, we can make sure that
        our pies are absolutelythe best.
